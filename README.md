## Hi there! I'm Max.

I'm a web developer based in Madison, WI. I've been working at Arizona State University since 2019 maintaining various Drupal web sites while keeping up to date with the JavaScript, React, and static site generators. 

### Specialties

I learned to code in JavaScript, so I'm a fan of all things JS: React, Node, Express, etc. On the database side of things, I have experience with MySQL and MongoDB, along with their associated ORM libraries (Sequelize and Mongoose, respectively). My current job has me doing web content management in Drupal, with a sprinkling of direct work in PHP and raw SQL.
