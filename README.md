## Hi there! I'm Max.

I'm a web developer based in Tempe, AZ, and moving soon to Madison, WI. I've been working at Arizona State University since 2019 maintaining various financial aid web sites and apps. 

### Specialties

I learned to code in JavaScript, so I'm a fan of all things JS: React, Node, Express, etc. On the database side of things, I have experience with MySQL and MongoDB, along with their associated ORM libraries (Sequelize and Mongoose, respectively). My current job has me doing web content management in Drupal, with a sprinkling of direct work in PHP and raw SQL.
